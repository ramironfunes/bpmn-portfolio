# 🌀 BPMN Portfolio

This repository hosts my collection of **business process models (BPMN diagrams)** and related artifacts (e.g. database models) created as part of my functional analysis work. Here I showcase how I map, document, and optimize workflows for software and business systems.

---

## 📂 What’s Inside

- **Diagrams/** – BPMN 2.0 process diagrams (in `.png`, `.bpmn`, `.xml` or exported formats).  
- **DB-Models/** – Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERDs) and data schema models.  
- **Docs/** – Supporting documentation: model descriptions, conventions, assumptions.  
- **README.md** – This file, with overview and guidance.

---

## 🎯 Purpose & Goals

- To demonstrate my ability to **translate business logic into process flows** using a standard notation.  
- To show how I integrate **process models with data models** (DB / ERD) for a more holistic design.  
- To build a **reference portfolio** I can share in interviews or link in LinkedIn.  
- To maintain a **living collection** of processes I can evolve and reuse across projects.

## 🛠️ How to Use / Browse

1. Clone this repo locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ramironfunes/bpmn-portfolio.git
   cd bpmn-portfolio
Open any BPMN or DB model file (e.g. via Camunda Modeler, Visual Paradigm, or any BPMN/ERD tool).

Read the Docs/ files for context:

What the process achieves,

Key decisions and exceptions,

Data dependencies.

📐 Conventions & Best Practices
Models follow BPMN 2.0 standard notation.

Use consistent naming for tasks, gateways, and events.

Always include start and end events, and define exception paths.

In DB models: show primary keys (PK), foreign keys (FK), and cardinalities.

Document assumptions, constraints, and terminology used in each model.

🌱 Future Additions
More advanced BPMN samples: collaborative processes, subprocesses, event-based flows.

Integration of BPMN and DB models: show data objects in processes.

Versioning / change logs of process evolution.

Automatic generation of documentation from models (e.g. export to HTML).
